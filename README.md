# postie

A simple app to understand how the `postMessage` web API works.

## Purpose

This app is designed to explore and demonstrate the `postMessage` API, particularly as LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) tools are moving towards using this web API as an alternative to session cookies for cross-origin communication.
